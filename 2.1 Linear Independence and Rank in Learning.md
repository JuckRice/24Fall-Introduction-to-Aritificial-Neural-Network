## Meaning of linear equation

The solution process of many machine learning models can be reduced to solving a system of linear equations 
$$Aw=d$$
where 
- $A$ : **Features Matrix(特征矩阵)** 
	- Including attributes of data, usually it's where you store all the training data;
	- 每一列可以看作是一种属性或者特征，每一行可以看作是一个数据点的所有特征向量;
	- E.g. when predicting the housing price, *every row* represents all the attributes of a single house, like the area and house age. And *every column* represents a kind of attributes, like area and house age.
	
- $w$ : **Parameters(参数)**
	- The weight or parameter vector;
	- Decide how much weight each attributes in $A$ is combined.

- $d$ : **Labels(标签)**
	- The observed outputs or labels, usually it it the target of the model.

## Linear Independence

- A set of $M$ vectors $v_1,v_2,...,v_n \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is linear independence, **if and only if** $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}v_i\alpha_i=0$$$$\alpha_i=0,i=1,2,..,n$$
- Otherwise, these vectors are linear dependent.

## Rank of a matrix

- The number of independent columns or rows of a matrix;
- The rank of column vectors = The rank of row vectors.

## Solution of linear equation

If we represent the column vector of $A$ as elements, we have
$$Aw=d$$
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
a_1 & a_2 & ...&a_n
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
w_1\\
w_2\\
...\\
w_n
\end{bmatrix}=d
$$
We can say that $d$ is the *weighted sum of A*.

When we look at the geometric meaning of this, we can say that if indeed there is a $d$ satisfies the equation, meaning that $d$ can be represented as a weighted combination of the column vector of $A$ 
Assume that A only has 2 column vectors (denotes as $a_1$, $a_2$).  If there is a $d$ satisfies the equation, it means that $d$ (e.g. the blue or pink vectors) must lies in the space or plane decided by $a_1, a_2$ (e.g. yellow and the green vectors).

We can transform the equation into
$$Aw-d=0$$
or
$$\sum_{i=0}^na_nw+(-1)d=0$$
The coefficient of $d$ is non-zero, which indicates that $a_1,a_2,...,a_n,d$ are linear dependent. 

**We can draw conclusion that**

- If $Aw=d$ has a solution, geometrically $d$ lies in the space decided by $a_n$, in other words,  $a_1,a_2,...,a_n,d$ are *linear dependent*, so that $rank[A]=rank[A|d]$. 

- If $Aw=d$ has no solution, geometrically $d$ doesn't lie in the space decided by $a_n$, and $a_1,a_2,...,a_n,d$ are *linear independent*, so that $rank[A]<rank[A|d]$.
